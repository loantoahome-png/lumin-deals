# Verification Log — Lumin Deals

### [2026-06-16] File: app/api/sync/ghl/route.ts
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Funded volume was not LOS-authoritative. The GHL sync update path
(`maybeSet('loan_amount')`) overwrote a funded deal's Arive-imported `loan_amount`
with GHL's opportunity `monetaryValue` whenever the opp changed. The reconcile
block already guarded funded deals (`pipeline_group !== 'Funded'`), but the main
update path did not — an inconsistency.
**Changes:** Carried `pipeline_group` into the `byOppId` dedup index (`DealKey`,
`DedupRow`, both `.select()`s, `ingestDedupRow`). Added a guard in the update-path
`maybeSet` so `loan_amount` is skipped when the existing deal is Funded — Arive is
authoritative for closed loans. Guard is scoped to Funded only.
**Test Method:** Simulated OLD vs NEW update-path logic against the two live drift
cases + a non-funded control, using each deal's stored `raw_ghl_data.monetaryValue`.
**Result:**
- Craig English — GHL monetaryValue `0`; OLD clobbered to `0`, NEW preserves `67,812.74`.
- Lorelei David — GHL `110,956`; OLD clobbered, NEW preserves Arive `116,492.70`.
- Non-funded control — still accepts GHL value `250,000` (guard correctly scoped).
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: changed file type-clean (only pre-existing errors remain).

### [2026-06-16] File: app/funded/page.tsx
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Funded page showed volume but not revenue. The Arive broker comp lives in
`compensation_amount` (set on 49 of 150 funded deals); the dead `revenue` column is
null for all funded deals.
**Changes:** Added `totalComp` (Σ `compensation_amount`) and render it next to funded
volume in the header, only when > 0.
**Test Method:** Confirmed `fetchAllDeals` defaults to `select('*')` so comp is
returned; `Deal` type carries `compensation_amount`; tsc clean.
**Result:** Header now reads "{n} deals · {volume} funded volume · {comp} comp".
LOS-authoritative revenue, consistent with lead-spend (which already sums comp).

### [2026-06-16] Data fix: Mario Nieto $432k phantom funded row
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Deal `ea2bba9e` (Mario Nieto, $432k, "Loan Funded", no arive#, no funded_date)
was a phantom. Live GHL (contact 9yRiiinpoO4w4fhaUCvU) has 4 opps: 3× Mario all **lost**
($305,250 / $305,250 / $210,000) + Olga Alvarez $119,106.98 **won**. The row's opp
`lXFc5JNrYZ6upSTuNOdG` was DELETED in GHL; the funded-deal prune guard flags-not-deletes
funded rows, so the orphan persisted. Real closing ($119,106.98 under Olga) is already a
separate funded row (`56bb46ba`, arive 16651764).
**Changes:** Demoted to pipeline_group='Not Ready', status='Not Qualified - Income'
(documented reason: couldn't qualify; funded under wife Olga). Row backed up to
`_mario-nieto-phantom-backup-*.json`. Next maintenance sync prunes the orphan (opp gone).
**Result:** Funded 150→149; /health need-review 2→1 (only Stephen Coon remains).

### [2026-06-16] Feature: Cross-Source Identity Resolver (Contacts Phase 1)
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Frozen-at-insert borrower_id split ~40 people across multiple ids → false duplicates
on /duplicates (e.g. Marian Cooper's 3 loans, Rene Gonzalez).
**Changes:** New `lib/identityResolver.ts` (pure guarded-transitive union-find over
ghl_contact_id ∪ email ∪ phone, weak-value blocklist, never name; oldest borrower_id wins) +
`runIdentityResolutionPass` (paginate, safety cap 20 / 200, sync_state backup, batched writes);
`POST /api/resolve-identities` (dry-run default); 30-min auto-heal hook in the maintenance cron.
**Test Method:** 9 fixture assertions (npx tsc compile + node) + live dry-run review + live apply
+ acceptance queries.
**Result:**
- Fixtures: Marian collapses (oldest wins), role-email & junk-phone strangers NOT merged,
  transitivity works, idempotent — ALL PASS.
- Live dry-run: 40 components, 55 rewrites, largest=8 (Rene Gonzalez, manually confirmed one
  real person — identical email/phone/contact-id across 8 loans). No abort.
- Live apply: 55 borrower_ids rewritten; backup = sync_state key
  identity_resolve_backup_2026-06-16T23:29:11.673Z.
- Post-apply: Marian's 3 deals → 1 borrower_id; same-contact-id splits 31 → 0; idempotent
  re-run rewrites 0.

### [2026-06-16] Feature: Contacts table + person view (Phase 2)
**Status:** VERIFIED (data + logic + build) — live visual is user-confirmable
**Changes:** `contacts` table (id = canonical borrower_id; supabase-contacts.sql, installed by
Efrain). Resolver extended: `buildComponents` (now also links by borrower_id so keyless Arive rows
join their person), `computeContactRows`, and `runIdentityResolutionPass` upserts/prunes contacts
on every apply. `/contacts` list + `/contacts/[id]` person page; Sidebar nav link.
**Test Method:** 20 fixtures (incl. keyless-row + contact rollups) via tsc+node; live populate +
acceptance queries; prod build (compiles all routes).
**Result:**
- Fixtures: ALL PASS (20).
- Live populate: 1454 contacts == 1454 distinct borrower_id; 0 orphans.
- Marian Cooper = ONE contact, loan_count 4, funded 3, $941,700 volume, both GHL contact ids,
  name+email populated (fixed the keyless-row clobber that first showed loan_count 1).
- Top contacts sane (Rene Gonzalez 8 loans).
- Deployed (commit 4e5422c) — prod build READY → /contacts routes compile.
**Not verified here:** live browser render (preview tool grabbed a different project + app is
auth-gated) — visual confirm is on the live site.
