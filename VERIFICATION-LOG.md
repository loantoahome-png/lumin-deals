# Verification Log — Lumin Deals

### [2026-06-16] File: app/api/sync/ghl/route.ts
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Funded volume was not LOS-authoritative. The GHL sync update path
(`maybeSet('loan_amount')`) overwrote a funded deal's Arive-imported `loan_amount`
with GHL's opportunity `monetaryValue` whenever the opp changed. The reconcile
block already guarded funded deals (`pipeline_group !== 'Funded'`), but the main
update path did not — an inconsistency.
**Changes:** Carried `pipeline_group` into the `byOppId` dedup index (`DealKey`,
`DedupRow`, both `.select()`s, `ingestDedupRow`). Added a guard in the update-path
`maybeSet` so `loan_amount` is skipped when the existing deal is Funded — Arive is
authoritative for closed loans. Guard is scoped to Funded only.
**Test Method:** Simulated OLD vs NEW update-path logic against the two live drift
cases + a non-funded control, using each deal's stored `raw_ghl_data.monetaryValue`.
**Result:**
- Craig English — GHL monetaryValue `0`; OLD clobbered to `0`, NEW preserves `67,812.74`.
- Lorelei David — GHL `110,956`; OLD clobbered, NEW preserves Arive `116,492.70`.
- Non-funded control — still accepts GHL value `250,000` (guard correctly scoped).
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: changed file type-clean (only pre-existing errors remain).

### [2026-06-16] File: app/funded/page.tsx
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Issue:** Funded page showed volume but not revenue. The Arive broker comp lives in
`compensation_amount` (set on 49 of 150 funded deals); the dead `revenue` column is
null for all funded deals.
**Changes:** Added `totalComp` (Σ `compensation_amount`) and render it next to funded
volume in the header, only when > 0.
**Test Method:** Confirmed `fetchAllDeals` defaults to `select('*')` so comp is
returned; `Deal` type carries `compensation_amount`; tsc clean.
**Result:** Header now reads "{n} deals · {volume} funded volume · {comp} comp".
LOS-authoritative revenue, consistent with lead-spend (which already sums comp).
